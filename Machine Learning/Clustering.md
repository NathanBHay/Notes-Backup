Clustering is an [[Machine Learning#Unsupervised Learning|unsupervised]] [[Machine Learning|machine learning]] algorithm used to [[Classification|classify]] data. The most common of these clustering algorithms is K-means.

# K-means
K-mean clustering functions in a two step structure, which follows assign points to centroid, and move centroid. This step repeats until the most efficient centroid is found. The method to work this out is done by finding the minimum distance between assigned centroids.
