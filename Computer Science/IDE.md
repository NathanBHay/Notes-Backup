An Integrated development environment (IDE) is an application used for software development that allows for the writing of code with a set of tooling. These improve productivity through the use of tools such as debuggers,  language servers, and syntax highlighting. Some commonly used IDEs are:
- **Visual Studio**, a basic editor with many extensions.
- **[[Vim]]**, a text editor which has support for plugins that an IDE usually has.
- **Emacs**, a [[Lisp|lisp]] powered editor.

# Debugger
A debugger is a tool that is used for finding bugs within a program usually through sequential execution of instructions with memory readouts. A debugger works by stepping through either compiled or interpreted instructions, stopping a **break points** specified by the programmer. The **debugger adaptor protocol** (DAP) is standard way of implementing debuggers that allow for a wide variety of editors to easily connect to a debugger.

# Language Server 
The language server protocol (LSP) is a way of implementing language specific features such as code completion, type hints, errors, and refactoring routines.
