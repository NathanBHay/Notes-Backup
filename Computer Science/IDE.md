An Integrated development environment (IDE) is an application used for software development that allows for the writing of code with a set of tooling. These improve productivity through the use of tools such as debuggers,  language servers, and syntax highlighting. Some commonly used IDEs are:
- **Visual Studio**, a basic editor with many extensions.
- **[[Vim]]**, a text editor which has support for plugins that an IDE usually has.
- **Emacs**, a [[Lisp|lisp]] powered editor.

A [[Debugging|debugger]] is a tool used to track the execution of code. These are commonly integrated into IDEs.

# Language Server 
The language server protocol (LSP) is a way of implementing language specific features such as code completion, type hints, errors, and refactoring routines.

# Formatter
A code formatter ensures that code conforms to a certain style. This ensures uniformity while minimising unnecessary [[Git]] line edits. There are many different tools which are available for every programming language. In general most align with a specification published by the language creators.
