Virtualisation is the idea of dividing computational resources into 


There are three main virtualisation levels:
- **Hardware virtualisation** where independent machines are created that use a portion of the system's hardware.
- **Operating system virtualisation** where an [[Operating System|OS]] with its own set of applications are used as a unit.
- **Application level** where multiple applications can be managed through [[Containerisation|containers]].
