Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services, including servers, storage, databases, and more, over the internet. This allows data to be kept offsite and used by multiple users, lowering infrastructure and operation costs.

# Types
Cloud Computing has several models and strategies that are done to meet specific user needs. The three main models are:
- **Infrastructure as a Service** (IAAS) contains the basic components for cloud computing, providing access to network features, computers, and data storage space. IAAS provides a high flexibility and control over IT resources.
- **Platform as a Service** (PAAS) removes organisational management for the infrastructure and allows a focus on the deployment of applications. This is efficient as it allows users not not worry about maintaining the platform.
- **Software as a Service** (SAAS) provides a completed product managed and ran by the provider. This software is usually considered the end-user application where data is managed by the provider while you build upon the service your own software.

These services build upon each other as to make up the technical backend of cloud technology. While these three main services provide ways for a user to connect to a provider there are also three deployment methods that determine how an application runs based on the level of cloud computing required. These are:
- **Cloud-Based** applications are fully deployed on the cloud. This allows them to be ran on the platform supplied by the cloud provider, abstracting away the low-level management of the cloud system.
- **Hybrid** deployment is used to connect cloud based resources between existing resources not located in the cloud. This allows more valuable data to be kept on-premise within your own network, while expanding your capabilities with computational power being located off site.
- **On-premises** deployment, also called private cloud, keeps all data on premise. While this removes many cloud computing advantages it does allow direct control over your own servers. This model is similar to legacy systems except it allows data to be virtualised across different buildings within a company.
