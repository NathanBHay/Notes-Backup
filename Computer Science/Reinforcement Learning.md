Reinforcement learning, also called approximate dynamic programming, is a form of [[Machine Learning|machine learning]] and approach to [[Artificial Intelligence|artificial intelligence]] where the agent has to choose **actions** based on their **observation** of the **environment**. These problems learn a **policy** which decides upon the optimal actions given the observed state. This [[Optimisation|optimisation]] is based upon a **reward/objective function** that strengthens good behaviour and penalises bad. Reinforcement learning is good in cases where an analytical solution is not available or in cases where simulations are tractable.

Basic reinforcement learning models problems as a [[Markov Decision Process#Partially Observable MDP|partially observable Markov decision process]].
