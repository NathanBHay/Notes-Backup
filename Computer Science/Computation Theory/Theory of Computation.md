The theory of computation is a branch of computer science that provides a formal definition of what computation is, as well as the differing complexities of computation. The theory of computation is split into three main fields, [[Automata Theory|automata theory]], [[Formal Languages|formal languages]], and [[Computability Theory|computability theory]]. Automata theory is the study of abstract machines which compute problems through the transition of states. Formal languages describe languages as the set of operations over an alphabet. Computability theory discusses the extent to which problems are solvable by computers.

There are a variety of different models of computation which all define in their own terms what is considered computable. These are:
- **[[Turing Machine]]** which models computing through an infinite set of memory, and a reading device which reads the memory and is able to move from state.
- **[[Lambda Calculus]]** which considers computation as a expression of lambda terms that can be deduced.
- **Combinatory logic** is another notation similar to lambda calculus 
- **$\mu$-recursive functions** see computation as consisting of functions which use recursion to compute values.
- **Markov algorithm** which uses a system of string rewriting to simulate grammar-like rules on strings.
- **Register machine** represents computation as a set of instructions on registers which hold integer values.
