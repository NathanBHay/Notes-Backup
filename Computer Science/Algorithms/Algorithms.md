An algorithm is a series of instructions which have a defined input-output relation. They are usually defined within mathematics using logical statements. These statements are then interpreted into [[Programming Languages|programming languages]]. Common algorithms include [[Sorting Algorithms|sorting algorithms]], [[A-Star|graph algorithms]], and more.

# Analysis
Analysis of algorithms is the process of determining the advantages and disadvantages of algorithms. There are various canonical approaches to the contrasting of algorithms. The main approach is through [[Complexity Analysis|complexity analysis]] which applies mathematics to algorithm runtime analysis. An expansion of this technique is seen in [[Amortized Analysis|amortized analysis]] which uses the principles of complexity analysis for [[Data Structures|data structures]].

# Loop Invariant
The loop invariant is a property of a loop which remains true before and after each iteration. Loop invariants can be expressed through [[Predicate Logic|predicate logic]] for a formal proof. A loop invariant is usually a statement that can be used to prove the correctness of an algorithm. This is done through validating that the loop meets its precondition such that it loops correctly, and then ensuring each iteration results in the correct output, and finally justifying its termination.

# Correctness
Algorithms can be proved to be correct through a variety of techniques. These include:
- Existence proofs, coding the algorithm to demonstrate it works.
- Counter-examples, identify when the algorithm breaks.
- Characterisation, which is to test key properties of the algorithms.
- Comparison, through benchmarks.
- Indicators, test criteria and variables.
- Experiments, uses experiments on artificial and real cases.
- Scalability, can it handle larger data.
- Limitations, where does it fail.

Proof techniques can also be used either through formal methods such as [[Proofs#Induction|induction]].

# Online
An online algorithm is one that processes input sequentially without knowing all data in advance. This is as opposed to an offline algorithm which knows all data in advance. For example, insertion sort is an online sorting algorithm.
