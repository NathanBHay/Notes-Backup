Cycle detection is the problem of finding the cycle in a sequence of values. Mathematically, for any function $f$ that maps a finite set $S$ to itself, and any initial value $x_0\in S$ the sequence of iterated values must repeat over a certain length. Cycle detection finds the first value $x_i$ and the last value $x_j$. Cycle detection is common within [[Graph Theory|graph theory]] as the function $f$ can be seen to create a graph structure.

# Naive Cycle Detection
The naive approach to cycle detection can be computed by storing a set of all states generated by computing $f(x)$. This approach can be implemented using a [[Hashtables|hash set]] which minimises algorithm complexity.
```pseudo
	\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{CycleDetect($f,x$)}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\State $S \gets \emptyset$
		\While{$x \neq \null$}
			\State $S\gets S \cup \{x\}$
			\If{$x \in S$}
				\Return \True
            \EndIf
			\State $x \gets f(x)$
        \EndWhile
		\Return \False
	\end{algorithmic}
	\end{algorithm}
```

# Floyd Cycle Detection
Floyd's cycle detection improves upon the naive approach by reducing space complexity to $O(1)$.
```pseudo
	\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Floyd($f, x$)}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\State $slow \gets f(x)$
		\State $fast \gets f(f(x))$
		\While{$fast \neq \null$}
			\If{$fast = slow$}
				\Return \True
            \EndIf
			\State $slow \gets f(slow)$
			\State $fast \gets f(f(fast))$
        \EndWhile
        \Return \False
	\end{algorithmic}
	\end{algorithm}
```
