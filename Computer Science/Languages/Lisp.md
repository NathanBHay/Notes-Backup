List Processor or Lisp is a family of programming languages which are programmed through linked lists. It is a [[Functional Programming|functional language]] which focuses on the creation of a language system within itself. Due to Lisp being a family of languages there are many different variants of the language. These include:
- **Common Lisp** a more generic standard of lisp, which includes more paradigms.
- **Scheme** a minimal implementation of lisp with a focus on functional paradigms.
- **Clojure** a more functional interpretation that exists of the [[Java|JVM]].
- **Racket** a scheme standard that expands the language.
