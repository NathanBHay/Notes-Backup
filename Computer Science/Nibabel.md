Nibabel is a medical imaging library that is able to load various MRI and CT scans through its `nii.gz` format. A nibabel image is divided into three parts:
- *Image data array*, which is a 3D or 4D array of image data.
- *Affine array*, that tells the position of the image array data in a reference space.
- *Image metadata* describing the image.
