Hill climbing is an [[Optimisation|optimisation]] technique that can be used to find a solution to a problem. It is an iterative algorithm that functions by computing the solution at a given point, before comparing the next solution by moving values incrementally. This is continues until a local optima is found. Due to this the algorithm is poor at finding global optima. Hill climbing is used in cases where there are very few local optima (such as convex problems) and a simple algorithm is desired.
