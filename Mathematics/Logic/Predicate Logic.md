Predicate or first-order logic is used to quantify [[Propositional Logic|propositional statements]]. These statements are constructed of variables over a **domain** of values. Predicates usually have one or multiple **arguments** which specify how certain values within a domain are handled. Quantifiers are used to illustrate statements on variables. Some of these quantifiers include:
- $\exists$ there exists at least one, is the **existential quantifier**.
- $\exists!$ there exists only one.
- $\nexists$ there doesn't exist.
- $\forall$ for all, is the **universal quantifier**.
From these statements can be built up.

A negation of quantifier is logically equivalent to:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\lnot \forall xP(x) \equiv \exists x \lnot P(x) \\
\lnot \exists xP(x) \equiv \forall x \lnot P(X)
\end{aligned}
$$
A **valid sentence** is any statement which is always true under predicate logic. Adversely an **invalid sentence** is any that is always false.
