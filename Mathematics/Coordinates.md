Coordinates are the way points or sections of a graph are illustrated. There are a variety of coordinate types that can be used.

# Cartesian Coordinates
Cartesian Coordinates are the basic coordinates used within most mathematical equations. A cartesian plot takes variables usually with the parameters $x,y,z$. From this coordinate points can be represented as [[Set Theory#Ordered Pair|ordered pairs]] that are placed on a graph.

# Polar Coordinates
Polar Coordinates are a coordinate type defined in relation to the origin. This is done through an [[Set Theory#Ordered Pair|ordered pair]] which keeps the magnitude, and angle of a point. This has the notation:
$$(r,\theta)$$
These can be converted to cartesian coordinates through the rules:
$$x=r \cos \theta \text{ and } y=r\sin\theta$$
To convert these cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates you follow the rules:
$$r^2=x^2+y^2 \text{ and } \tan \theta = \frac y x$$
