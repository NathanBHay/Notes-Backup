The standard score or **z-score** is a statistical measure within [[Probability|probability]] that tests the number of [[Continuous Probability#Variance|standard deviations]] by which the raw score, an observed value or data point, is above or below the mean value being measured. A positive score means the result is above the mean while a negative implies below. The score can be calculated as:
$$z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$$
Where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ is the mean and standard deviation of the population while $x$ is the observed value. A predicted z-score can be also made using a sample mean and deviation.

In the case of [[Hypothesis Testing|hypothesis testing]] the $x$ can be calculated as $\hat\theta$ and the $\mu$ and $\sigma$ can be calculated using the proposed hypothesis $\theta_0$.
