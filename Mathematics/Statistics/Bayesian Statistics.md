Bayesian statistics functions on the central statement of **Bayes' Theorem** which allows a way to calculate [[Probability#Conditional Probability|conditional probability]]. This theorem is states:
$$\Pr(A|B) = \frac {\Pr(B|A)\Pr(A)} {\Pr(B|A)\Pr(A) + \Pr(B| \overline A)\Pr(\overline A)}= \frac {\Pr(B|A)\Pr(A)} {\Pr(B)}$$
