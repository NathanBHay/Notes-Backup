Similarity 

# Dice Coefficient 
The **Sorensen-Dice Coefficient**, commonly called the dice score or dice metric is a score used to quantify the similarity between sets. For example for two sets, $X$ and $Y$, to find the score simply compute:
$$D(X,Y)=\frac{2\cdot|X\cap Y|}{|X|+|Y|}$$
For problems with multiple classes the dice coefficient can be computed seperately for every class. These can then be averaged out to find the net dice coefficient.
