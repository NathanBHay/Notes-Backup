Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics which focuses on the calculation of triangles. Its central ideas focus on the ratios of the sides of a triangle as to produce solve problems. There are three main ratios within trigonometry, sine, cosine and tangent. These [[Functions|functions]] are defined on angle $A$ which is the angle between the adjacent and hypotenuse. The **Sine** function is represented by the rule:
$$\sin A = \frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}$$
The **Cosine** function follows the ratio:
$$\cos A = \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}$$
The **Tangent** function can be defined as:
$$\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}=\frac{opposite}{adjacent}$$
Both these ratios work as the hypotenuse value is cancelled out. The reciprocal of these functions can also be found, and have their own names. The reciprocal of sine called **Cosecant** can be defined as:
$$\csc A = \frac{1}{\sin A}=\frac{hypotenuse}{opposite}$$
The reciprocal of cosine is named **Secant** and follows the rule:
$$\sec A = \frac{1}{\cos A}=\frac{hypotenuse}{adjacent}$$
The reciprocal of tangent which is **Cotangent** can be defined as the ratio:
$$\cot A = \frac{1}{\tan A}=\frac{\cos A}{\sin A}=\frac{adjacent}{opposite}$$
Through the use of all these ratios elements within triangles can be founds, as well as the creation of functions based on these ratios.

# Circular Functions
Trigonometric ratios can be represented on the domain of a circle, called the **unit circle**. This circle which has a radius of one produces functions whose ordered pairs follow the [[Relations|relation]]:
$$\{(\cos \theta, \sin \theta):\theta \in \mathbb{R}\}$$
The separate trigonometric functions can be graphed as to produce varying graphs. The solutions to all these functions

## Circular Function Solutions
Some of the most common trigonometric functions have solutions which are commonly used. These are:

| $\theta$        | $\sin$        | $\cos$ | $\tan$ |$\sec$|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $0$  | 0 | $1$ |$0$| |
| $\frac{\pi}{6}$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ |$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ |$\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$| |
| $\frac{\pi}{4}$ | $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$| $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ |$1$| |
| $\frac{\pi}{3}$ | $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$|$\frac{1}{2}$|$\sqrt{3}$ | |
| $\frac{\pi}{2}$ | $1$| $0$| $\frac{1}{2}$ | |

# Hyperbolic Function
Trigonometric ratios can also be represented by a hyperbola, called the **unit hyperbola**. This hyperbola is defined as $x^2-y^2=1$ where the triangle formed is formed by a sector with the area equal to $\frac{x}{2}$. The **Hyperbolic Sine** function can be defined by the rule:
$$\sinh x= \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}$$
The **Hyperbolic Cosine** function follows the definition:
$$\cosh x= \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}$$
The **Hyperbolic Tangent** function can be derived from the previous to functions as to produce the result:
$$\tanh x= \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}$$
All these functions have a reciprocal that can be found, as well as an inverse. The **inverse of Hyperbolic Sine** can be found as:
$$\cosh^{-1}= \ln(x+\sqrt{x^2+1})$$
The **inverse of Hyperbolic Cosine** is found through the rule:
$$\cosh^{-1}= \ln(x+\sqrt{x^2-1})$$
The **inverse of Hyperbolic Tangent** has the definition:
$$\tanh^{-1}= \frac{1}{2} \ln (\frac{1+x}{1-x})$$
