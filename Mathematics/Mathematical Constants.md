Within the field of mathematics there are key numbers which appear within nature that are set to a fixed value. Most usually have an infinite trail of decimal digits which makes entire calculation impossible, and thus only estimated to a few digits. These numbers are usually represented by a symbol. All named mathematical constants are definable and are computable.

# Pi
The constant $\pi$ pi is a value found within Euclidean geometry as the ration between the circumference and the diameter of the circle. This number appears throughout mathematics. Some of its digits are:
$$\pi\approx3.1415926\dots$$
# Euler's Number
Euler's Number $e$ is a number which appears commonly within exponential [[Functions|function]], compounding interest, and the base of natural logarithms. It can be defined as:
$$e=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac 1 {n!}=\lim_{n\to\infty} (1+\frac 1 n)^n\approx 2.71828\dots$$
This number is important as its [[Differentiation|derivative]] can be found as $e$ as well as the integral being equal to $e$.

# Golden Ratio
The golden ratio is a ratio between two numbers such that their sum is the same as the ratio between the numbers. Expressed algebraically as:
$$\varphi=\frac{a+b}{a}=\frac{a}{b}$$
The number is closely associated with the Fibonacci sequence and can be found within nature. It's irrational form is defined as:
$$\varphi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\approx1.618033\dots$$
