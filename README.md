# Obsidian Notes Backup
The following repository is a collection of all my notes on various subjects within CS, Math, and Social Sciences. The goal of this is to function as a monthly backup of the notes I have written, while also allowing them to be easily shared. This project of writing notes digitally started around March 2022, during my first year of university. Due to my classes making me write repeated handwritten notes I decided to collect all my writing in a single location that I would be able to add on to indefinitely. Therefore this is my attempt at making a second brain.

The application I use for writing these notes is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) a note taking tool that allows for dynamic linking of notes. You can find the my configuration of Obsidian in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/NathanBHay/.dotfiles) repository.

*Disclaimer: While I did write most of these notes, I don't claim total ownership over them as they miss references to sources that I most likely paraphrased.*
