Speed reading is a technique of reading at a fast pace while reducing the loss of significant information. This usually involves the reduction of unimportant information to get the main essence of a text. From a [[Learning Theory#Cognitivism|cognitive]] view the goal is to reduce extraneous load caused by unimportant data. While the research on speed reading is limited, especially in cases where individuals claim reading over 1000 words per-minute, the techniques given still provide a possible aid in improving reading speed.

**Subvocalisation** is the idea of reading by hearing the individual words as they are read. This form of reading while having the greatest comprehension lacks speed to a significant degree. The speed being bound by the speed of internal speech which ranges from 200-300 words per-minute. Speed reading strategies attempt to improve this speed.

There are a variety of approaches to achieving forms of fast visual reading. 
- **Skimming** involves scanning text to get a overview of the information. This is good at getting the main ideas while minimising significant information.
- **Previewing** uses pre-reading of important information such as headings, charts, bold text and reading introductions/conclusions. This improves comprehension during the reading of specific text. *Reading in reverse* is an associated strategy.
- **Chunking** breaks text into smaller sections as to focus on that section. This can improve comprehension.
- **Pacing** where a specific reading speed is set to improve focus and prevent slowdowns.
- **Eliminating** which ignores certain parts of the next to remove redundant information. This improves efficiency at the cost of possibly removing data.
- **Finger or pen guide** where a guide is used to provide focus on what is being read. This can reduce re-reading or distractions by keeping track of progress.
- **Eye resting** uses regular breaks to reduce strain from reading. This can be done through closing eyes or focusing on a distant object.
