Generative learning provides a set of strategies for implementing a form of constructivism. It views generative learning as distinct from rote learning such as direct instruction, or associative learning like [[Learning Theory#Constructivism|constructivism]]. Rather it focuses on creating meaningful connections that allow for rote and transfer learning.

Generative learning focuses on **learning strategies** as the approach to improve teaching rather than **instructional design**, where materials are improved to improve learning. By focusing on learning strategies this enables learners to gain insights how to most efficiently learn.

Generative learning can be divided into eight main strategies summarising, mapping, drawing, imagining, self-testing, self-explaining, teaching and enacting. These are used to activate three main cognitive processes:
- **Selecting** where important information is extracted.
- **Organising** where the information is organised within conceptual models.
- **Integrating** where the information is moved into long-term memory.

# Summarising
Summarising is the process of restating ideas into own's own words. Through this process the key ideas are extracted and placed within the context of the student's ideas. This is backed up evidence which indicates summarisation, and training in doing so significantly improves comprehension of main details, and to a lesser degree on minor ones. Some evidence notes that writing additional summaries provides diminishing returns.

# Mapping
Mapping uses spatial arrangements like concept maps and knowledge maps to organise information. This links key ideas and their associated relationships. Similar to summarisation this allows building upon the student's knowledge. Mapping can be done through three methods, concept mapping, knowledge mapping, and graphic organiser mapping. Each of these approaches being more constrained than the last.

# Drawing
Drawing is a strategy of learning where drawing is used to visualise learning, selecting key information and spatially arranging it. The best drawings are considered organisational and/or explanative as they provide structure and demonstrate how ideas and systems work. Despite the advantages the difficulty of drawing can decrease some of the advantages, with drawing from instruction indicated to improve efficiency.

# Imagining
Imagining content as a mental image can improve retention of information as it forces the learner to identify ideas and allows for a spatial representation with little overhead. The primary disadvantage of this method is the level of motivation required for this to be effective due to the lack of a physical activity. Additionally guidance is heavily recommended to improve the efficiency. Sufficient knowledge on the subject also can aid.

# Self-Testing
Self-testing involves answering practice questions as to further learning. This allows faster memorisation given the student has sufficiently practised the materials. Testing is improved when corrective feedback is provided. Short-answer tests are preferred over multiple choice as they force recollection to a greater degree.

# Self-Explaining
Self-explaining is a method of learning where the student explains the content to themselves during the learning process. Through this the student is able to easily relate their knowledge to existing knowledge and allows for them to select the key ideas out. Self-explanation is the strongest for studying diagrams and conceptual ideas. Similar strategies include journaling and elaborative interrogation, where the individual explains why a statement is true.

# Teaching
Teaching can improve the understanding of the teacher as it allows for simplification, and restating of ideas in a way that forces the teacher to internalise the ideas.  This effect is maximised in cases where the student is aware that they will need to teach this information. Restating information is a common pitfall which has been shown to decrease the benefits, especially amongst students that lack the requisite understanding. Research within this area is lacking, so while a positive impact is suggested the degree is still debatable.

# Enacting
Enacting is the idea of doing relevant movements during learning. This could involve manipulating objects in subjects like physics, performing gestures when doing maths and more. Ideally this helps map ideas to real-world objects or actions. These links help with internal organisation and selection of ideas. This approach is the best for students with high-prior knowledge and are given guidance. Application of this works best in younger children.
