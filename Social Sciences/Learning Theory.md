Learning theory within psychology and education describes how students process and remember information during learning. This provides a conceptual framework for how to improve effective learning rate. There are various differing theories which attempt to model different aspects of education.

Classical theories around education usually revolve around Platonic epistemology where knowledge is imparted within the soul and education involves recollection of that information from birth and reinforcing it into the soul. Locke offered a different perspective where humans are blank slates that pick up knowledge for their environment. These ideas propelled the thinking of education within the 20th century where learning theory was first discussed.

# Behaviourism
Behaviourism, also called traditional learning theory, is the idea that learning is done through interaction to the outside environment. This means to learn teaching needs to be done, with the success of this teaching heavily dependent on how this is done. A more complex definition sees this as the acquisition of new behaviours through [[Conditioning|conditioning]] and social learning.

Teaching through this approach usually involves setting up a controlled environment that uses positive reinforcement to educate individuals. This belief is underpinned by **transfer learning** where knowledge achieved in a classroom can be applied with similar effectiveness to other environments. Therefore *learning through association*. Some teaching techniques which adhere to behaviourism include:
- **Direct instruction** where teaching is done through lectures or demonstrations that depict desired results.
- **Competencies**/**behavioural objectives** where students achieve certain competency levels to indicate improvement in knowledge and content difficulty.
- **Early intensive behaviour intervention** where ASD children are taught how to act at a young age to reduce the effects of spectrum disorders.
- **Curriculum-based measurement** where education outcomes are monitored by student performance through tests and other metrics.

Behaviourism is criticised for its simplicity die to its failure to address the human mind within the context of learning. Proponents note that the human mind is subjective and thus analysis is difficult however behaviourism is discredited today.

# Cognitivism
Cognitivism focuses on the internal processes of the mind and how it impacts education. The main approach to learning within this model is through mental stimulation such as asking thought provoking questions, or problem-solving activities so that they expand existing knowledge. This means learning is more efficient if students use their own thinking to process new information. Cognitive theories emphasise **active learning** where students apply their skills rather than **passive learning** where students memorise information.

Learning within this framework is usually self directed learning where organisation of information into conceptual models is key. This means a curriculum with a focus on the sequence of content within the context of the bigger picture. Some common strategies within this framework are visualisations to enhance recall, and participation through students explaining and justifying their thinking.

## Two-Store Model
The two-store model or the dual memory model is a model within cognitivism that models memory as segmented into **long-term memory** and short-term **working memory**. This approach while considered incomplete is the basis of many congitive theories.

## Cognitive Load Theory
Cognitive load theory is a cognitive theory that suggests learning has a certain capacity within a space of time. Once this mental storage is used students will have a negative effects decreasing memory and comprehension. Cognitive load can be identified to follow three different forms:
- **Intrinsic load** is the inherent difficulty of learning information. To reduce this workload simplifying the task can be done depending on learning intentions.
- **Extraneous load** which is load caused by the presentation of the materials and its environment. Ensuring materials are simply and the environment distraction free can decrease this form of load.
- **Germane load** which are components that help with the construction of schemas. This means use of diagrams and other organisation can reduce the intrinsic load.

Application of these ideas within the context of education should focus on simplicity within study design as to decrease intrinsic and manage extraneous loads. While also using visualisations to reduce intrinsic load. Some strategies for this include:
- Reducing problem space by breaking tasks into easier sections as to reduce working memory usage.
- Adapting presentation to follow level of expertise as to avoid expected information that may slow down the learning process.
- Use of visual and auditory channels within working memory.

Criticism of this theory comes from two perspectives. The first is the disputing of these effects especially as some experiments have indicated otherwise. The other is the focus on direct instruction rather than other educational methods. This means effects of other learning techniques may have different effects on the cognitive load.

# Social Learning Theory
Social learning theory states individuals learn from the imitation of others within a social environment. This expands behavioural and cognitive theories as to include direction instructional methods through conditioning without understating importance on cognition. With the addition of the ideas that an observational learning process exists along with a mediating process. These theories focus on the education of children most significantly with many of these theories applied to kindergarten and primary school.

**Observational learning** is the key idea of social learning and states that student learn through observing social environments. The **mediational process** is the idea that for social learning to occur certain conditions need to be present. If these 4 are then the external stimuli of social learning can be correctly memorised. These conditions are attention, whether students notice the behaviour, retention, whether they memorise it, reproduction, performing it, motivation reward exceeds costs.

Application of these theories within education involves emphasising imitation and observation of the educator. Creation of a motivated environment amongst peers can also improve the rate of learning.

# Constructivism
Constructivism is the theory that students establish their understanding through experiences and prior knowledge rather than passively absorbed. This means learning involves constructing an understanding from pre-existing ideas and placing it within that context. Personal interpretation of information is important in this model as it dictates interpretation. Like other models constructivism puts focus on active learning and the use of social interactions to learn.

There are various proponents of constructivism resulting in variations on the theory. Some examples of this include:
- **Cognitive constructivism**, proposed by Jean Piaget, focuses on cognitive development and how construction of ideas happens during these stages.
- **Social constructivism**, proposed by Lev Vygotsky, focuses on social learning and its collaborative potential within constructing ideas. The *zone of proximal development* is the range of knowledge that a student possesses given proximity to a more knowledgeable individual. In this type of constructivism the goal is to reinforce and expand this zone.
- **Radical constructivism**, focuses on the subjective aspects of the learners knowledge and emphasises that the student dictates every aspect of learning.

Educating with constructivism starts with an understanding of the general pre-existing knowledge of individuals. Education sessions can vary with little structure focusing on discovery learning, or more directed approach where teachers pull upon previous knowledge.

Some common frameworks which use the constructivist model are:
- **Inquiry-based learning** is an approach which directs education through individualised research projects. Teaching within this framework involves students constructing open-ended questions which they research.

Constructivism is criticised for its lack of structure making it difficult to ensure students are learning. This is especially present in cases where grading is ignored as it becomes harder to address struggling students. Furthermore the lack of direction can make it difficult for teachers to decide upon a curriculum. Overall this can also create difficulties in social and emotional development.

# Humanism Learning Theory
Humanist learning theory uses ideas of constructivism but places more important on the individual and their self-actualisation. Education through this method involves courting the students individual learning preferences as to allow them to learn in their individualistic way. Humanism also focuses on meeting the emotional and social needs of the individual in the learning process.

# Connectivism
Connectivism builds upon constructivism to pull it into a modern digital context where learning is done through compilation of various sources. This idea of looking at multiple sources furthers ideas of constructivism as now students learn through both sources with similar understanding and background and more diverse perspectives.

Connectivism uses the concept of nodes and links from [[Graph Theory|graph theory]] to frame knowledge. **Nodes** are essential sources of information such as people, organisations, pages, generative models, etc. These are connected through **links** that traverse between these nodes. These links can manifest through mutual discussion, hyperlinks, or academic references. Through this idea connectivism emphasises the importance of these nodes and their associated links, promoting students to think critically about sources. This nurtures critical thinking and the ability to research.

Application of this within the classroom is similar to constructivism where individual inquiry is promoted but with a greater degree of focus on assessing quality of resources. Teachers with therefore have a more supportive role, pushing the student to think rather than directing it. Some additional classroom strategies which are common is the gamification of learning, and the use of social media in education.
