Psychoactive drugs, psychopharmaceuticals, or psychotropic drugs are a type of chemical substance that changes functions within the nervous system resulting in a change in perception, mood, consciousness, and behaviour. These substances are usually used medically, recreationally or for religious purposes. Psychoactive drugs are commonly considered controlled substances by countries due to their inherit danger. Some legal psychotropics include caffeine and alcohol. Psychoactive drugs are classified into 5 main categories. These are:
- **Anxiolytics** which are used to reduce symptoms of anxiety or panic.
- **Empathogen-Entactogens** alter emotional state as to increase a sense of empathy, or closeness.
- **Stimulants** (uppers) increase wakefulness through a stimulation of the mind.
- **Depressants** (downers) evoke a calming, sleep inducing effects.
- **Hallucinogens** produce alterations in perception and emotional state.

**Entheogens** are a classification and model for certain drugs associated with religious use. Generally entheogens are psychoactive drugs that are used for a spiritual purpose. These drugs are commonly in the category of hallucinogens, entactogens or alcohol. Many of these drugs have been traditionally used within religious rituals with examples including Catholic communion, and native-American shamans. This means most drugs found within nature are commonly considered entheogens. In addition to these, some synthesized drugs such as LSD or MDMA can be considered entheogens by their respective users.

Psychoactive drugs operate through temporarily affecting a person's neurochemistry which causes an change in mood, perception or behaviour. The targeted neurotransmitter in question is different for all types of drugs. Drugs that increase activity in a particular neurotransmitter system are called **agonists**. These function through increasing chemical reactions in the brain, reducing reuptake from synapses, or mimicking brain activity through binding to a synaptic receptor. Drugs that reduce neurotransmitter activity are called **antagonists** and operate by interfering with chemical reactions or blocking receptors so that neurotransmitters can't bind to them. Exposure to psychoactive substances can result in changes to neural pathways as they attempt to account for the excess or decreased stimulation.

# Anxiolytics
Anxiolytics or anti-anxiety agents are medications that reduce anxiety. These are aren't commonly taken recreationally and are traditionally reserved for medical purposes in anxiety or depression treatment. Anxiolytics can be classified into: 
- **Antidepressants** used to treat forms of depression.
- **Benzodiazepines** used to treat anxiety and insomnia.
- **Azapirones** used as addons to antidepressants.
- **Anticonvulsants** used to treat seizures.
- **Antipsychotics** used to treat psychosis.
- **Beta-Blockers** used to prevent heart attacks.

The common mechanism in which anxiolytics inhibit are in the form of **selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors** (SSRI) and **serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors** (SNRI). These work through inhibiting reuptake of neurotransmitters which means the amount of serotonin and norepinephrine which are able to pass through neurons are increased. This allows people who have a low amount of serotonin or norepinephrine to increase their pool thus combating depression and anxiety. The other common mechanism is through benzodiazepines which bind to GABA receptors. Binding to these receptors increases the excitability of nerves and slows the system down. This can alleviate symptoms of anxiety.

# Empathogens
Empathogens or entactogens are a class of psychotropic drug that produces experiences of empathy or sympathy. Majority of these drugs are considered phenethylamines, or amphetamines although some are also tryptamines. The main drug within this category is 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and its associated family of *MDxx* drugs.

## MDMA
MDMA commonly known as ecstasy or moly is a empathogen with stimulant and minor psychedelic properties. First developed in 1912 it was originally used for psychotherapy beginning in the 1970s before becoming a popular street drug in the 1980s. MDMA functions as an agonist that increases the release of primarily serotonin but additionally dopamine and noradrenaline.

# Stimulants
Stimulants or uppers are an umbrella term for drugs that increase the activity of the central nervous system or increase heart rate and blood pressure. Stimulants are used for treatment of mental disorders, recreation and performance enhancement. The mechanism which stimulants target is usually by enhancing neurotransmitters that are employed in the regulatory pathways as to increase arousal, motivation or reward anticipation. Classical stimulants either block the reuptake or stimulate these neurotransmitters. Some stimulants especially those within the empathogen or hallucinogen class also effect the transmission of serotonin. Stimulants such as those within the amphetamine class decrease the negative feedback by antagonising regulatory receptors. The last common method of action is adrenaline agonists that increase the flow of ephedrine. 

## Caffeine
Caffeine is a commonly consumed drug that blocks the binding of adenosine a receptor used to promote sleep, increasing alertness. Caffeine can produce a mild form of dependence associated with withdrawal symptoms. It has a onset of action of around 45 minutes to an hour with 3 to 4 hours of effects.

## Depressants
Depressants are drugs that lower neurotransmission levels within various areas of the brain. Depressants are commonly consumed recreationally as well as medically through anesthesia. Similar to uppers the mechanism of action is dependent on the classification of depressant. 

# Hallucinogens
Hallucinogens are a class of psychoactive drugs that produce an altered state of consciousness. These drugs can be further subclassified into three main types dissociatives, psychedelics. Classification of a hallucinogen usually takes in account the facts the drug predominately effects thought, perception or mood while minimising nervous system side effects and intellectual impairment.

# Dissociatives
Dissociatives are a subclass of hallucinogen that distort perception as to produce feelings of detachment from environment or self. 

# Psychedelics
Psychedelics are a subclass of hallucinogens that trigger non-ordinary mental states commonly called *trips*. These traditionally result in psychological, visual and auditory changes.

# Deliriants
Deliriants are a subclass of hallucinogen that produce effects of delirium that
