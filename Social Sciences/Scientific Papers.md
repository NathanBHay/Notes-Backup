Academic publishing is the method of publishing scientific papers which are the result of research. Through papers scientific knowledge can be expressed in a way that is able to reach a scientific audience.

# Paper Structure
A scientific paper is structured around a series of sections that demonstrate a basic research process on the paper. It has the following sections:
- **Abstract** is a summary of the entire scientific paper.
- **Introduction** which usually states the importance of the research, and the basic ideas of the subject, using other papers as a reference.
- **Method** states the way the experiment or design is proposed. It can include the materials required to repeat the results or any other data.
- **Result** uses the method to find the results of a paper.
- **Discussion** discusses these results and accesses method.
- **Conclusion** states the finalised results in a way that can be expressed in relation to the bigger picture.

# Paper Types
## Literature Review
A literature review is a large part of the research process for scientific papers. The goal of a literature review is to discover the current knowledge on the subject through research on a series of articles previously written. A literature review can be published at the start of a scientific paper as to illustrate the basis of the research, or by itself as a way to collate current knowledge on the subject.

**Systematic literature review** is the more rigorous process of running a taxonomy and analysis of papers within a field. This involves a more open research process where bias attempts to be removed.

## Pre-Print Papers
A pre-print paper is a version of a scientific paper before it has been peer-reviewed or published. These papers are usually publicly available by the authors on a preprint server such as Arxiv.org.

# Peer Reviews
Peer reviews are a method of validating a research paper through the review of a professional. This evaluation results in an experts opinion on the subjects. There are multiple types of peer-reviews that are done as to ensure that bias is minimized. These common peer-review types are:
- **Blind review** is a where reviewers are unaware of the identity of the authors.
- **Double blind review** is where both reviewers and authors are unaware of each others identities.
- **Open review** is more transparent and allows for the identities of authors and reviewers are published.

# Goals of Papers
There are many goals of writing a research paper (some articles call these patterns) which are present within the majority of papers. While more of an observation papers broadly follow a narrative that tries to pursue a few main ideas. These are:
- *Fill in the blank*, where the goal of the paper is to explore an area that has little research. This could be in applying techniques to another domain, or discussion of assumptions made within other papers.
- *Expansion*, which improves an existing discovery to either improve it or apply it to a different context.
- *Generalisation*, where an existing observation is generalised to find a bigger paradigm.
- *Reproduction*, that follows the steps of a previous paper as a way to either review the research or then expand it.
- *Automation*, which applies a method to automate existing techniques to improve efficiency.
