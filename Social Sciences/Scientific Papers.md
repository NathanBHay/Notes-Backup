Academic publishing is the method of publishing scientific papers which are the result of research. Through papers scientific knowledge can be expressed in a way that is able to reach a scientific audience.

## Paper Structure
A scientific paper is structured around a series of sections that demonstrate a basic research process on the paper. It has the following sections:
- **Abstract** is a summary of the entire scientific paper.
- **Introduction** which usually states the importance of the research, and the basic ideas of the subject, using other papers as a reference.
- **Method** states the way the experiment or design is proposed. It can include the materials required to repeat the results or any other data.
- **Result** uses the method to find the results of a paper.
- **Discussion** discusses these results and accesses method.
- **Conclusion** states the finalised results in a way that can be expressed in relation to the bigger picture.

## Literature Review
A literature review is a large part of the research process for scientific papers. The goal of a literature review is to discover the current knowledge on the subject through research on a series of articles previously written. A literature review can be published at the start of a scientific paper as to illustrate the basis of the research, or by itself as a way to collate current knowledge on the subject.

## Pre-Print Papers
A pre-print paper is a version of a scientific paper before it has been peer-reviewed or published. These papers are usually publicly available by the authors on a preprint server such as Arxiv.org.

## Peer Reviews
Peer reviews are a method of validating a research paper through the review of a professional. This evaluation results in an experts opinion on the subjects. There are multiple types of peer-reviews that are done as to ensure that bias is minimized. These common peer-review types are:
- **Blind review** is a where reviewers are unaware of the identity of the authors.
- **Double blind review** is where both reviewers and authors are unaware of each others identities.
- **Open review** is more transparent and allows for the identities of authors and reviewers are published.
