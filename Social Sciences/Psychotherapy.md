Most psychotherapy is done through talking to a therapist. There are multiple different approaches psychotherapy. These include:
- **Behavioural based** studies the behaviours of individuals as to change how one acts in given situations.
- **Cognitive based** which focuses on changing the thoughts of an individual.
- **Humanistic** aims to depict how subjective meaning and self-actualization effects people.

These branches only illustrate a broad categorization with there existing many different approaches to therapy.

## Cognitive Behaviour Therapy
Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) which focuses on a person's thoughts, feelings and actions and how they effect perception and wellbeing. CBT focuses on challenging cognitive distortions such as thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes. 

## Dialectical Behaviour Therapy
Dialectical behaviour therapy is a form of CBT that focuses on the managing of strong emotions and acceptance of life. Acceptance is considered as the start of DBT, where in order to change one must accept their emotions. Getting a patient to accept themselves usually involves discussion of validation, which is the empathy and the communication that a perspective is valid. This involves helping them accept their past actions and current emotions. An important part of this is not promoting dysfunctional behaviours but rather validating the emotions behind it.

DBT tries to help others by allowing them to experience emotions without coping mechanism firing. To achieve this exposure therapy principles are used that allows the patient to build up emotional competence. Validation during this stage is important as it builds trust and allows the individual to gain perspective that will help during the change phase.

Change is the next step within DBT. The first suggestion before starting to change is to create a map of your metacognition. This process involves modelling thoughts and behaviours and how they effect each other to cause other thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, finding avenues for change through the cause and effect process. The benefits of this may be over exaggerated as the benefit may come from the active process of being invested in your mental health.

## Mindful-Based Cognitive Therapy
Mindful-based cognitive therapy is a type of CBT that integrates mindfulness. Mindfulness is a practice of metacognition that is defined as nonjudgmentally observing phenomena such as perceptions, cognitions, emotions, or sensations. This skill is commonly practiced through mediations and reflection. Particular focus is put on the idea that emotions and thoughts are transient.
