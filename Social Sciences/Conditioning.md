Conditioning is the idea that behaviours are reinforced by the environment individuals are present within. This is reliant of the idea of the stimulus-response where given a certain stimulus such as a reward, and individual will give a response. Conditioning expands this as to demonstrate how these responses to stimuli can be learned and predicted.

# Conditioning Types
**Classical conditioning**, also called Pavlovian or respondent conditioning, proposes that when multiple *stimulus*, also called *antecedent* are associated commonly they can elicit the same *response* even if one of them doesn't trigger that response. This relates to Pavlov's dog where the dog hears a bell when it eats leading to the dog being ready to eat, measured by salivation upon hearing the bell.

**Operant conditioning**, or instrumental conditioning, differs from classical conditioning as it focuses on events that happen voluntarily. Rather than forcing conditioning to take place it results from natural actions giving a reinforcement.  Depending on the theory of education operant conditioning is usually viewed as a possible motivator within education. 

# Conditioning Schedules
Conditioning can be divided into the schedule in which it happens. This is important for application within psychology of [[Learning Theory|teaching]] as it governs the rate at which the reinforcement will occur.
- **Continuous reinforcement** provides reinforcement after every response.
- **Intermittent reinforcement** schedules these events, either based on amounts of responses, gaps between responses or more advanced variable interval schedules.
