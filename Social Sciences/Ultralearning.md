Ultralearning is an approach to learning, proposed by Scott Young, in the self help book of the same title. Ultralearning to Young is the strategy for acquiring skills through intense self education. Due to skill polarisation within the workforce and cost of tuition Young creates a list of strategies to aid with learning at a fast and competitive rate.

Ultralearning views learning as a project, and to achieve this project 9 main principles are discussed.

# Meta-Learning
Meta-learning, which starts by devising a curriculum to follow to their goals. This process can be broken down into 5 stages. First start by finding the reasoning behind your learning objectives and if they will actually result in the desired outcome. After this decide what needs to be learned, especially in relation to understanding concepts, memorising facts, and being able to do procedures. From this you are able to address bottlenecks ahead of time. Finally decide how you are going to learn the information. An easily approach to this is modifying existing curriculum to highlight aspects.

# Focus
Focus, learning how to concentrate. Strategies to improve focus relate to decreasing procrastination, and increasing concentration. Concentration can be studied from the perspective of arousal (the more general kind), and task complexity. Where arousal allows harsher focus on the activity at the cost of more creative thoughts being decreased. Meaning simple tasks can be done quicker but more difficult ones done slower. This means in cases such as problem solving managing your arousal through breaks or ensuring your environment is quiet can help.

# Directness
Directness, focus on achieving your goal rather than other tasks. To illustrate this idea Young references the failure of [[Learning Theory#Behaviourism|direct instruction]] methods of teaching and their lack of relevance to learning concepts well. Rather an approach to directly learning materials can be done through:
- *Projects*, where a task with a goal is devised which allows for learning to take place.
- *Immersion*, where learning is fostered through the environment.
- *Simulation*, some things can't be learned through practice, so trying to simulate the environment in a way that allows you to learn is vital.

# Drill
Drilling is the process of working on aspects of what your learning as to improve your skill. This can be done through a variety of drill methodologies. Time slicing is an approach to this which where time is spent learning a single aspect. Focusing on aspects by copying or simplifying other tasks can also aid. The last one noted was prerequisite chaining where once their is difficulty with a certain component focus on its

# Retrieval
Retrieval is the process of using methods of learning that force retrieval of information from memory rather than reviewing that material. A common approach to this is through testing which forces key information to be retrieved. Young cites evidence of testing being a stronger approach that other similar review methods even in cases where a test wasn't the metric of success. Some approaches to retrieval are flash cards, free recall, creating questions with links to answers instead of writing notes, and closed book learning.

# Feedback
Feedback is shown to have many benefits when it comes to achieving learnine outcomes. The types of feedback broadly are outcome feedback, which whether it's correct, information feedback which indicates whats wrong, and corrective feedback which indicates what needs to be fixed. In general it is best to find the most direct and detailed feedback possible as it allows you to shift your focus to fixing issues quicker.

Feedback can be improved through a few different ways. The first is to remove unnecessary information from feedback, the next is to ensure the feedback is on an appropriately difficult task. Meta-feedback which is feedback on how your learning is going can also be very high quality. Lastly rapid feedback offers the most obvious approach.

# Retention
Memory retention is an important aspect of consolidating growth potential. There are three predominant theories for how information is lost. *Decay* is the basic belief that the memory of information decays with time. Under this strategy tools such as reminders are key. *Interference* is the idea that memories relate to each other causing easier or more difficult memorisation. *Forgotten cues* states information isn't lost but rather requires specific cues to remember it. Strategies for memory retention include:
- Spaced repetition is the spacing of education out over multiple repeated cycles. This has been shown to be extremely effective for retention.
- Procedurisation is the idea that following a general procedure or set of instructions can allow one to internalise this and improve retention.
- Overlearning is practising or reciting information already learnt. This is good for short-term benefits however applied in conjunction with the previous techniques it may be beneficial.
- Mneumonics are tools used to remember information. This can include remembering keywords, pictures, or any other cue.

# Intuition
Intuition allows knowledge to become internalised. There are various strategies to achieving this including pursuing hard problems and not giving up. Proving ideas from the ground up to understand them in their entirety. Starting with examples before learning concepts.

# Experimentation
Experimenting with different aspects of the learning process allows for a greater analysis of how to improve one's abilities. A common approach to experimentation is through testing different learning materials. After this the choice of technique becomes important. Finally deciding upon style is the last important aspect. This style can combine distinct areas of knowledge unique to yourself.
